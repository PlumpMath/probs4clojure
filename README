# probs4clojure

These are my solutions to problems on 4clojure.com.  They are
incomplete (I only started saving solutions partway into the 'medium'
problems) and some of them are pretty rough.  Just keeping them here
as a record, and in case people have suggestions or find them helpful
for some reason.  But, quoting Joe Hirn, "4clojure's not a game, it's
for learning. Is there value in cheating from my answers? Be good!"

Typically I work the problem in src/probs4clojure/core.clj and then
copy to solved.clj when the tests pass.
