# probs4clojure

These are my (and only my) solutions to problems on 4clojure.com.
They are incomplete (I only started saving solutions partway into the
'medium' problems) and some of them are pretty rough.  Just keeping
them here as a record, and in case people have suggestions or find
them helpful for some reason.  Feel free to learn from them, but I
solved the problems on my own first in each case, and recommend you do
the same.

Typically I work the problem in src/probs4clojure/core.clj and then
copy to solved.clj when the tests pass.
