# probs4clojure

These are my solutions to problems on 4clojure.com.  They are
incomplete and some of them are pretty rough.  Just keeping them here
as a record, and in case people have suggestions or find them helpful
for some reason.

Typically I work the problem in src/probs4clojure/core.clj and then
copy to solved.clj when the tests pass.
