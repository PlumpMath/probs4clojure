## 4clojure.com problems

These are my (and only my) solutions to problems on 4clojure.com. They
are still incomplete. Older solutions are in
`src/probs4clojure/core.clj`; **newer ones** (as well as a cute macro
for testing against the supplied unit tests) are in
`test/probs4clojure/core_test.clj`.

Feel free to learn from these, but I solved the problems on my own
first in each case, and recommend you do the same -- the ones you find
the hardest, you may learn the most from doing.
